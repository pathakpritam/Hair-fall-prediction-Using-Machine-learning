# Project Overview :-

Hair fall can be influenced by various factors such as genetics, hormonal changes, medical conditions, medications, nutritional deficiencies, stress, age, and environmental factors.
This project aims to predict the likelihood of hair fall based on these factors using various machine learning models.

# Models and Techniques :-

Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

# Results :-

The performance of each model was evaluated using cross-validation mean accuracy:

Logistic Regression: 0.4835

Decision Tree: 0.5355

Random Forest: 0.5135

Gradient Boosting: 0.5295

SVM: 0.5165


# Conclusion :-

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict hair fall based on various factors. 
Among the models trained, the Decision Tree model performed the best with a Decision Tree accuracy of 53.55%. Future work could involve improving model performance through hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and exploring more advanced algorithms. 
Additionally, deploying the model through web interfaces like  Gradio makes it accessible for practical use.
